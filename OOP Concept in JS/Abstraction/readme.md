<h1>Abstraction</h1>
<p>Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. It allows you to focus on the essential features of an object and hide unnecessary details. In javascript, you can use abstract classes to define abstract structures and then implement them in concrete objects</p>
